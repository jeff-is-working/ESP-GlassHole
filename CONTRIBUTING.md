I learned this is an important document to add, so I do.

For now, I would be happy if people report issues and bugs or give me I formation on other smart glasses I am currently not covering, e.g. by dumping BTLE adv frames here. You may use [nRF Connect for Mobile by Nordic Semiconductors](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp) for that.

I would also be glad if someone diggs I to the ToDos from [README](README.md), e.g. looking at an iOS port.

If you want to contribute code, make sure your pull requests contain *details* that help me to understand what your changes are intended to improve. 

Keep in mind: This is maintained by a single developer, me, who is not a professional developer I. terms of Android apps or Bluetooth protocols. It might take longer for me to understand your contribution.

I learned that this is an important document to add, hence I did.

# PLEASE WAIT ANd BE PATIENT
I reworked the licensing now, switching to *AGPL3.0*. 

If you would like to contribute to the development of this project, I would really appreciate it. But please bear in mind: This project is maintained by one person only, @yjeanrenaud, that is me, who is not a professional developer, especially not in terms of Android apps or Bluetooth protocols, and at all.

It may therefore take me longer to understand your contribution, so please explain things if you contribute to this project. I am currently overwhelmed by the attention that this small side project has received, and I would like to rule out major flaws and mistakes first. Again, I am no professional developer. I code as a hobby, so I am sure I make a lot of silly mistakes. However, I try to learn and improve. That's what life is about, at least from my perspective.
## Todos 
Please take a look at the 'Todos' that I added to the [README.md](README.md#Todos). That list is by no means exhaustive, but it may give you an idea of where I want to take the project next.
I am quite new to developing software with people I don't know personally or professionally. For now, I don't feel comfortable relinquishing too much control over this repository, so you may find my design decisions and workflow procedures a little irritating. Again, I am trying to learn.

## 2. Grant of Rights

### 2.1 Copyright License to Us and back to You

1. You retain ownership of the Copyright in Your Contribution.
2. You grant Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable license to reproduce, modify, display, perform, and distribute and relicense under any license you choose (including proprietary or permissive licenses) the Contribution as part of the Material (conditioned on Section 2.5).
3. You have the same rights to use or license the Contribution which You would have had without entering into the Agreement.

### 2.2 Moral rights
Moral rights remain unaffected to the extent they are recognized and not waivable by applicable law. To the maximum extent permitted by law, You waive any moral rights that might apply. In any event, You may add your name in the Credits for `Nearby Glasses` releases.

### 2.3 Copyright Assignment

1. At submission, You assign Us all right, title, and interest in the Contribution’s Copyright (conditioned on Section 2.5).
2. To the extent rights cannot be assigned, You grant Us an irrevocable license to exercise such rights.
3. Rights You cannot assign or license are irrevocably waived.
4. We grant You a license back under these rights to use the Contribution similarly to an owner (but not to the Material).

### 2.4 Outbound License

Based on the grant of rights in Sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 if we include Your Contribution in a Material, We may license the Contribution under any license, including copyleft, permissive, commercial, or proprietary licenses, so long as it is also licensed under the Material’s license.

We are not obligated to use Your Contribution.

## 4. Disclaimer

THE CONTRIBUTION IS PROVIDED *AS IS*. MORE PARTICULARLY, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY YOU TO US AND BY US TO YOU.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL YOU OR US BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.

---

## 6. Approximation of disclaimer and damage waiver

IF THE DISCLAIMER AND DAMAGE WAIVER MENTIONED IN SECTION 6 AND SECTION 7 CANNOT BE GIVEN LEGAL EFFECT UNDER APPLICABLE LOCAL LAW, REVIEWING COURTS SHALL APPLY LOCAL LAW THAT MOST CLOSELY APPROXIMATES AN ABSOLUTE WAIVER OF ALL CIVIL LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONTRIBUTION.

---

## 7. Terms

This Agreement shall come into effect upon Your acceptance of the terms and conditions.

You shall have the right to terminate the Agreement in written form if We do not fulfill the obligations as set forth in Section 3.

In the event of a termination of this Agreement Sections 5, 6, and 8 shall survive such termination and shall remain in full force thereafter. For the avoidance of doubt, Contributions which are already licensed under a free and open source license at the date of the termination shall remain in full force after the termination of this Agreement.
